# Fastly Purge using an api key
Fastly

This is a basic url purger that prompts you for the url you want to purge on fastly.

Once you provide the url, it will output the request as verification it was taken in and then give you a status.

This requires an API key in the file fastlyPurge.js.

Hope it makes life easier for everyone!

Thanks!
